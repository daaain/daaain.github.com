### Guard-Steering

[https://github.com/daaain/guard-steering](https://github.com/daaain/guard-steering)

Lets you set up a [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) that will run [Steering](https://github.com/pixeltrix/steering) whenever a [Handlebars.js](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js) template is added / updated.

The reason this Gem was born is developing a HTML5 based desktop application which relies on static compilation. Still wanting to get the benefit of having fast Handlebars templating, precompilation is now done development time instead of loading the templates and letting the full runtime JS do the work.

### SmileBankStatementToCSV

[https://github.com/daaain/SmileBankStatementToCSV](https://github.com/daaain/SmileBankStatementToCSV)

A simple script to scrape statement data from Smile Bank's online banking interface for manual exporting.

Get Bookmarklet on the project page: [http://daaain.github.com/SmileBankStatementToCSV/](http://daaain.github.com/SmileBankStatementToCSV/)

Just log in to Smile and once you're on a statement page (works for both current and older ones) click on the bookmarklet.

In a few seconds after getting the statement data and converting to CSV it shows a jQuery Fancybox with the text preselected, so you only have to press ctrl + c / cmd + c and paste the exported data into your favourite texteditor.
