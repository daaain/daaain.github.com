The obligatory third person introduction:

Daniel (aka dain aka daaain) is an agile product manager and experience design technologist, being just as passionate about test driven development as user-centered design. He holds a degree in economics but got drawn into the world of design and development when Photoshop was at 6.0 and Flash was at 5.
