The obligatory third person introduction:

Daniel (aka dain aka daaain) is an experience design technologist and visual developer, being just as passionate about test driven development as user-centered design. He holds a degree in economics but got drawn into the world of design and development when Photoshop was at 6.0 and Flash was at 5. Lately he's been working on HTML applications in which he sees great potential. In his free time he's also hacking electronics to make them part of the Internet of Things, though with varying success.
