As part of the [Sustainability course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/sustain) I'm currently taking, I had to write a forum post around population growth. It was inspired by an article about the dwindling richness of sound recordings in nature and tried to articulate some thoughts around incorporating nature conservation into the economy.

> It's crazy how little respect humanity as a whole has towards untouched nature... Maybe it's time for it to be calculated as part of GDP so that land left alone to nature would contribute to this "sacred index" which seems to be the only thing which matters in the industrialised world? I wonder what could rein in our relentless colonisation of Earth with our population still set to rise at least for the next few decades.

> Unfortunately the UN can't force any country to do things differently than its often short-sighted politicians decide under the intoxicating lure of lobby money, maybe the best hope for a source of change could be regional supranational entities like the EU? The pollution / renewable energy generation targets mandated on the EU level are the only thing which I can see that is shaking the political elite into the barest minimum of action here in the UK. While the wealth generated here in London is just staggering, the city fails to meet basic air quality standards already pushed back from a few years ago after repeatedly failing to meet them.

Maybe it's actually a boon that Eastern Europe wasn't caught up in such a crazy rate of "development" that the really important things are ignored and sacrificed on the alter of "progress". Maybe it's because of the agrarian heritage which inevitably comes with a level of respect towards nature?

It also made me want to grab my sound recorder and go out to capture sounds of nature, maybe even juxtaposed with recordings from the city.
