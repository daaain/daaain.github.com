## Why you should stop installing development environment locally

This is a placeholder post for my talk about containers / Docker from [re:develop conference][1] 2015 conference in Bournemouth. I'll eventually write up the main points in a proper blog post form, but for now have a look at the embedded slides and video recording.

### Slides

### Code

Make sure to also have a look at the [companion repository on Github][2], which shows how to set up a Node based development environment with Docker. Of course it would work with anything else which runs on Linux, but this simple working example should give you a good starting point.
