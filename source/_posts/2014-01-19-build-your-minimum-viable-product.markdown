I gave a talk about building and iterating an MVP at the brilliant Workplace Hackshop organised by [HackHumanity](http://www.hackhumanity.org/).

It's a short presentation so take a look, but these are the just the main points for the busiest executives:

* Form key hypotheses – optimise for learning, not functionality
* Express your main value proposition
* Get it out – if you’re not ashamed of it you wasted time
* Measure every user interaction
* Know where your audience hangs out
* Look for customers ready to pay
* Fake it, kludge it, hack it together
